## 📝 Simple To-Do App (Node.js)

This is a small project I made to get familiar with Node.js. It's functional but **not multi-user**, so all to-dos are visible to everyone. Just a heads up—don’t add anything private!

## Features
- **Add To-Dos**: Got stuff to do? Add them to the list.
- **View To-Dos**: See the current list of tasks (yours and others').
- **Update To-Dos**: Need to tweak a task? You can edit it.
- **Delete To-Dos**: Finished something? Go ahead and remove it.

## Try It Out

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS (keeping it simple!)

## Running Locally
Wanna try running it yourself? Here’s how:

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Konathalavenkat/todo_app
   cd todo-app
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Future Ideas
- Add multi-user support (so everyone doesn’t see everyone’s tasks 😅).
- Add user accounts and logins.
- Polish the UI to make it look better.
